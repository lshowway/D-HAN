The source code of D-HAN

#### This is the source code of D-HAN: Dynamic News Recommendation with Hierarchical Attention Network. However, only the code of three tested datasets is uploaded.

> Since the main contributions include: (1) We propose to simultaneously capture different granular information, i.e., sentence-, element-, document- and sequence-level information for news recommendation. (2) We propose to recommend news dynamically by a time-aware document-level attention layer, which incorporates the absolute and relative time information. (3) We propose to incorporate negative sampling into the training process to facilitate model optimization.

> You can check the code for their corresponding implementation details, it is very easy to understand. Of course, if you have any questions, please create issues in this repo, and I will respond you as soon as possible.
